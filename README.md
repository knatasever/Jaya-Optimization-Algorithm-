Example of the use of a sample jaya optimization algorithm in a metamorphic malware solution

The Jaya is a simple and powerful global optimization
algorithm developed by Rao(2016) has been successfully applied to the benchmark
function of constraint and unconstrained problems. All though
it is parameter less algorithm as the TLBO is, however, it is
different since it does not require learner phase, i.e. it uses only
one phase is teacher phase, whereas the TLBO performs its
action in two phases. It is based on the fact that the solution can
be obtained for a given problem moving towards the best
solution, avoid the worst solution. It is the beauty of this
algorithm that it requires only few control parameters like
maximum number of generations and population size, and
number of design variables, most of the time common for any
algorithms. It does not need any algorithm specific control
parameters require extensive tuning before conducting the
actual computational experiments. The work procedure of the
Jaya algorithm is outlined in Algorithm-1 is simple to
understand (Pandey, 2016).
